# color-block-menu-react-d3-scale-chromatic

Personal project using [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic). It's an awesome module created for use with the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/) that I'm familiar with, however D3 isn't atually used here. Instead I'm using the module to pull color schemes from, and populating a menu-like react component with. The menu doesn't have any functionality besides hover and touch events.

### Prerequisites

npm

### Installing

Install the required packages with

```
npm ci
```

then run

```
npm start
```
